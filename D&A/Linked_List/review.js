Linked Lists:

Are comprised of nodes
The nodes contain a link to the next node (and also the previous node for bidirectional linked lists)
Can be unidirectional or bidirectional
Are a basic data structure, and form the basis for many other data structures
Have a single head node, which serves as the first node in the list
Require some maintenance in order to add or remove nodes

Linked lists are often used when the number of items in the list is unknown or may change over time, as they can dynamically allocate memory for each new node.
In addition to the basic operations of adding and removing nodes, linked lists also support operations such as searching for a particular node, sorting the list, and merging two lists together.
Linked lists have some advantages over arrays in certain situations, such as when inserting or deleting elements from the middle of the list, as these operations can be more efficient than with an array.
However, linked lists also have some disadvantages, such as slower access times than arrays for retrieving a specific element, and the extra memory required to store the links between nodes. 

The choice of data structure depends on the specific needs of the application.
