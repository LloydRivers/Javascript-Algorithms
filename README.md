# Algorithms

Welcome to my repository for learning algorithms! This is a place where I will be exploring different algorithms because I feel like I need to increase my ability to solve more complex problems at work. The repository is organized into different folders based on the type of algorithms.

## Folders

### Sort

This folder contains implementations of different sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and quicksort.

### Reduce

This folder contains implementations of reduction algorithms, which are used to transform data into a simpler or smaller form.
